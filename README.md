# Smart Noise Monitoring System :sound:
SMNS is an indoor noise monitoring system exploiting IoT devices (ESP32 microcontroller and MAX4466 microphone) to detect, store (on [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com) and alert (on [Grafana](https://grafana.com) dashboard) when certain noise level is reached for a specific amount of time.
A Flask web page is available to set the system parameters.
